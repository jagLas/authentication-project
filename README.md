## Long Practice - Authenticate Me

In this multi-phase project, you will learn how to put together an entire Express application with authentication. When you are finished, you will have a full project starter that you could use for creating your first API.

## Frontend phase

The backend that is used had slightly different instructions than what is provided in the readme. The primary differences are the use of sqlite3 instead of postrgressql and use of asynchhandlers around async route handlers.
